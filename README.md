# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

Module 5 challenge repo

## Description

This challenge required me to create a work-day scheduler. Not only should the page populate a normal 9-5 schedule block, but those blocks should change based on what time it is currently. Gray means time has passed, red means time is current, and green is all future hours. You can write in any block and save said entry. Upon reload, that content will remain on the page as it has been saved to your local storage! This is scheudling made easy.
